    <p>The North FaceÂ® fundamental mission has remained unchanged since 1966:
providing the best equipment to our athletes and the modern explorer, supporting the conservation of nature and inspiring a global exploration movement.</p>

    <h3>Briefing</h3>
    <p>The North Face (TNF) has been a leading outdoor brand for more than 50 years. TNF is also increasingly manifesting itself as a lifestyle brand. As part of this strategy, TNF wants to bring a self-assembled high-tech backpack onto the market next year (based on the Access 02 backpack). TNF wants to sell this bag through a promotional site. Design the TNFCustom Bags promotional site. The other parts of www.thenorthface.com can be left out of consideration.</p>
